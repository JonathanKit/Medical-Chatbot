I find this statement somewhat misleading. There are many reasons why a person might experience increased thirst and weight gain. Statements like these from a robot (which I personally perceive as neutral) might lead me to simply label it as a symptom of an already known disease, without questioning the exact causes with a doctor. This could result in another illness remaining undetected for a while because I don't see the point in going to the doctor for that reason. | 5                                                                           | 20-40    |
